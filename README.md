# About

In this project I create an airbnb-clone site.
The application is broken down into several components to make it more organized and easier to maintain. The Navbar component contains the Airbnb logo and serves as a navigation element. The Hero component serves as an introduction banner to give users an overview of the website and encourage them to search for available accommodations.

The Card component serves as the main component and displays an Airbnb listing. Here, I use the data that I imported to display information such as the title, location, price, available spots, and rating. If there are available spots, a badge is displayed to indicate this.

The main component, App, is responsible for bringing all the components together on the page and defining the layout of the website. It also imports the data and creates a list of listings using the Card component.

- Dynamic rendering: I learned how to implement dynamic rendering in React to display a list of data.

- Conditional statements: I learned how to use conditional statements in React to check a condition and then perform an action, such as displaying a badge.

- Importing data: I learned how to import data from an external source and use it in the application.
